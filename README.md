# Simple JSON server

Quickly mock JSON response and try out the application

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Run JSON server
npm run db

# Run NGROK
npm run tunnel
```

Copy the random URL generated by ngrok and use it as an api.

### Point to Note

With free account, need to update url every 8 hours.
